tabs: UNIX V1 (1971/11/03) has a /etc/tabs file used for this purpose (cat /etc/tabs was equivalent to `tabs -8`), and it was moved to /usr/pub/tabs in UNIX V2 (1972/12/06). A program with very similar function also called tabs was introduced in PWB/UNIX 1.0 (1977/07/01) but its command line usage bears little resemblance to the current program, which was introduced with UNIX V7 (1979/01)
