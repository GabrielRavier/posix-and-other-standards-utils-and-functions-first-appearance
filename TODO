SWEEP THROUGH THINGS WE'VE DONE FOR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES/PATHS/IDENTIFIERS
hmmmmmmm... this is pretty random but perhaps add an entry for the first found instance of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabs ? (note: probably just add a file for formats in general)

glibc todo (look at headers for occurences of this for extension stuff, after looking at the corresponding standard if need be):
__USE_ATFILE
__USE_LARGEFILE
__USE_LARGEFILE64
__USE_FILE_OFFSET64
__USE_TIME_BITS64
__USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES
__USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL

Figure out where I should put `long double`

Missing stuff:
Read back through all the standards I guess
https://bitsavers.computerhistory.org/pdf/
Get all functions from gnulib too
Bash help topics to get all the builtin commands
Get more shell stuff like related env variables or sub-functions, etc. (do something like grep -r '"[^%,)]' | grep -vE '#include|_\(' on the bash source)
Windows APIs lol
GCC attributes, builtins and other extensions
C23 stuff
Check implementations of POSIX utilities for environment variables and paths
Add routines/headers/etc. from ncurses as they're likely to be extensions from other stuff (i.e. mark them as "common extensions to curses")
Add C operators
Add C++ stuff

Intel/AMD processor manuals
